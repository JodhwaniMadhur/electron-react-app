# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn add -D concurrently cross-env electron electron-builder electronmon wait-on`

Downloads all the node modules for the app.

### `yarn electron:start`
Starts the server on [localhost:3000](localhost:3000)


### `yarn electron:package:mac`
Builds the app for macOS to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

Just changing the `mac` to `win` or `linux` builds the app for Windows and Linux.
